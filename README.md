# Restaurant Data Analysis and Machine Learning Tasks

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Restaurant_Analysis_Notebook.ipynb`) that performs various data analysis and machine learning tasks on a restaurant dataset.

The tasks covered are:
1.  **Predict Restaurant Ratings:** Building a regression model to predict restaurant ratings based on features like cuisine, location, price range, and votes.
2.  **Restaurant Recommendation:** Demonstrating simple content-based and popularity-based recommendation systems.
3.  **Cuisine Classification:** Classifying the primary cuisine of a restaurant based on its name and location.
4.  **Location-based Analysis:** Exploring geographical patterns, clustering restaurants by location, and analyzing metrics like density and average ratings in different areas.
